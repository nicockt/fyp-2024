## Abstract
This paper examines the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in predicting stock market
crises based on various macroeconomic and financial variables. We trained a comprehensive set of
market and fundamental predictors from 10 markets to several machine learning models, namely Log
Regression (Log-R), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. With expanding window forecasting and validation
procedures, we predict stock crash for next quarter out-of-sample. We demonstrated that Log
Regression, SVM and XGBoost models outperform our benchmark model.
